# emacs.d

This is my Emacs config. It's setup to work a number of different
languages, and use Vim-style bindings via the excellent evil-mode.

## Requirements

* Emacs 23 or greater (note that Emacs 24 is required for some
  functionality, and will likely become the minimum required version
  some time soon.)

## Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```
git clone https://github.com/jcf/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
packages will be automatically downloaded and installed.
