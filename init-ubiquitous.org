* Ubiquitous

  Here we setup configuration and packages that are going to be so
  widely used we pretend they're built into Emacs.

** Packages

   [[s][s]] provides useful string utility functions.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init-ubiquitous.el :comments link
     (require 's)
   #+end_src

   [[f][f]] is a modern API for working with files and directories.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init-ubiquitous.el :comments link
     (require 'f)
   #+end_src

   [[fullframe]] makes it easy to take over the whole frame when you run a
   command, like ~magit-status~ for example.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init-ubiquitous.el :comments link
     (require 'fullframe)
   #+end_src

   [[diminish]] helps declutter our modeline by either by removing or
   abbreviating minor mode indicators.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init-ubiquitous.el :comments link
     (require 'diminish)
   #+end_src

   [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][~exec-path-from-shell~]] to pull ~PATH~ configuration from the user's
   shell.

   From the exec-path-from-shell [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell/blob/dccbb54b18950d64885daea9e98e49f15af1f0c9/README.md][README]]:

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   On OS X, an Emacs instance started from the graphical user
   interface will have a different environment than a shell in a
   terminal window, because OS X does not run a shell during the
   login. Obviously this will lead to unexpected results when calling
   external utilities like make from Emacs.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'exec-path-from-shell)

     (after-load 'exec-path-from-shell
       (dolist (var '("GPG_AGENT_INFO"
                      "LANG"
                      "LC_CTYPE"
                      "SSH_AGENT_PID"
                      "SSH_AUTH_SOCK"))
         (add-to-list 'exec-path-from-shell-variables var)))
